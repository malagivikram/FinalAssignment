# FinalAssignment
Please clone the repository and give a try for running it using the command prompt or terminals. (Please use the latest/updated test data from the feature file)

(As I have used Maven as a build automation tool for my Cucumber_Java_Selenium BDD Framework)

1. Run the command : "mvn clean test" to clean and Execute the maven project created
2. Run the command : "mvn verify -DskipTests" to get the detailed HTML report
3. After successful completion of Execution of the Project, please go to the project directory and navigate to 
 "target" folder >> "cucumber-report-html" >>  "cucumber-html-reports"
then select "file-src-test-resources-Features-EndtoEndTest-feature.html" file to have a look towards the html report, 
where we will find the Passed and Failed Feature,Scenarios,
Steps and also the Failed screenshots under the Failed scenario's Hooks sections.
